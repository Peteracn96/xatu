# Wannier90 to XATU interface

This program reads a `*_tb.dat` file from Wannier90 and outputs a XATU-ready input file in the format `*.model`.

### Location:
The program is located in:
```
xatu/utility/wannier2xatu
```

### Compilation:
To compile the program, navigate to the wannier2xatu directory and run:
```
$ make
```

### Running the Program:
The program requires the `*_tb.dat` file produced by Wannier90 as input. Please make sure the file remains unmodified (i.e., do not add or remove any lines from it).

To run the program, use the following command:
```
./wannier2xatu.x [FILE_WANNIER_90_tb.dat]
```
Replace `[FILE_WANNIER_90_tb.dat]` with the path to your actual `*_tb.dat` file.

### Notes:
Ensure that the input file format is strictly followed as generated by Wannier90.
The output will be a `*.model` with the same name as the file `*_tb.dat` file, ready for use in XATU.
